\arguments{
\item{cluster}{a named lists, with five names:
\code{base_clusters}, \code{samples}, \code{clustering_methods}, \code{label} and \code{robustness}.}

\item{selected_data}{a named list, with two names: \code{dataset} and \code{SeuratObject}.}

\item{params}{a list of parameters (cf. \code{feve::get_parameters()}).}

\item{logFC_threshold}{a numeric.}

\item{pvalue_threshold}{a numeric.}
}
\value{
a named vector associating differentially expressed features to their log2 fold-changes.
