\title{Get a composite plot summarizing a scEVE clustering analysis on a dataset with a ground truth.
The composite reports the relationships, the cell composition and the size of every leaf cluster
predicted by scEVE.}
\usage{
get_ground_truth_plot(records, ground_truth, widths = c(8, 4, 4))
}
\arguments{
\item{records}{a named list, with four data.frames: \code{samples}, \code{features}, \code{meta} and \code{methods}.}

\item{ground_truth}{a named factor associating samples to their class.}

\item{widths}{a vector of numeric.}
}
\value{
a composite plot.
}
