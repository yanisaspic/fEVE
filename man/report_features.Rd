\title{Report the characteristic features of the characterized clusters in the corresponding records sheet.}
\usage{
report_features(characterized_clusters, records)
}
\arguments{
\item{characterized_clusters}{a list where every element is a characterized pool of samples.
The elements are named lists, with seven names:
\code{base_clusters}, \code{samples}, \code{clustering_methods}, \code{label}, \code{features}, \code{robustness} and \code{specific_features}.}

\item{records}{a named list, with four data.frames: \code{samples}, \code{features}, \code{meta} and \code{methods}.}
}
\value{
a data.frame associating predicted populations to their characteristic features.
Its rows are genes, its columns are predicted populations,
and the strength of the characterization (e.g. log2-transformed pvalues) are reported in the table.
}
\description{
Report the characteristic features of the characterized clusters in the corresponding records sheet.
